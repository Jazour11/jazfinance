        <p>This is an application that has calculators for computing popular financial metrics, that are very important, and<br>
           all play major roles in our financial wellness. I added educative material so that the people who are not as <br>
           financially literate as some can understand the metrics, and use these metrics to change their family tree. Many<br>
           people have decided recently due to the uncertanity that the pandemic has caused that they want to stop <br>
           living paycheck to paycheck, because they are fed up with all of the fear that this lifestyle causes. I hope this<br>

                Compound interest is a very important concept when it comes to financial wellness. In simple terms this is the<br> 
                interest earned on previous interest.This means when you invest money, and it earns interest the next time it <br>
                earns interest it will earn interest on the original amount invested plus of top of the previous interest which<br> 
                causes it to compound over periods of time. This is same for debts except the interest is not going to you, its<br>
                coming from you, which is why it is important to keep your debt as low as possible in order to maximize your <br>
                wealth.For example if you purchase a home for $ 200,000 on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage at four percent interest<br>
                you will actually pay about $ 340,000 by the end of the mortgage which means the bank will will have an roi of <br>
                about 70 percent over the life of the loan before all of their fees, and and assuming you dont slip up at all along<br>
                the way. If you were able to opt for a 15 year mortgage on that same $ 200,000 dollar home you would only pay about<br>
                $ 301,000 which saves you $ 39,000 in interest expense that you can invest. If you invested this 39,000 that you<br>
                saved for 15 years that you would have left on your 30 year note, at the s&p 500s average return of 10 percent<br>
                compounded annually that $39,000 dollars has now become $162,912.68 saved all because you minimized your time <br>
                spent in debt. This is why learning about compound interest is really cool, and can help you to grow your net<br>
                worth, and make wise financial descisions. Please play around with the calculator I built in order to help you<br>
                dream, and help to plan for your future.<br><br><br>

                    This is one of the most important financial topics to help increase financial wellness. Many people are realizing with the<br> 
                    recent pandemic that emergency funds are absolutely vital in todays economy. In the past alot of people would spend their<br>
                    whole life at the same job, and that is much less common today. Job security is not the same as it was then making the <br>
                    emergency funds a vital financial concept for people to understand,and set aside money for. Most fincancial resources have<br>
                    always reccomended 3-6 months of expenses as a proper emergency fund, but with the recent pandemic stretching over 1 year.<br>
                    I think that it is important that when we have extra money we work on getting our emergency fund up to about 6-12months of<br>
                    expenses. An emergency fund is only to be used for emergencies. This is not to be used because you overspent as a safety <br>
                    net. It is for unexpected emergencies such as medicial emergencies, major car or applicance repairs, etc. The emergency<br>
                    fund can be a very important tool to break credit card, and personal debt borrowing because when you have an emergency<br>
                    that causes you to think irrationally you will have the money you need which will help you make wise descisions. Please<br>
                    come up with a budget that includes all of your expenses, and input the expenses below to calculate a proper emergency <br>
                    fund. When you see how much you need for your emergency fund, it may seem daunting, but you can attack this overtime. I<br>
                    think it is important to get this in place before investing, because it will allow you to not treat your investments as<br>
                    an emergency fund, so that you can hold longterm, in order for your investment to grow, and accumulate the compound<br>
                    interest that we talked about before.

                   Calculating the monthly payment of a debt that you have decided to take on is a very important and common thing.<br>
                   You can use this calculator to see what your payments will be, and what the best term of your loan would be. Some <br>
                   of the payments we may be interested in calculating include things like home mortgages, auto loans, personal debts<br>
                   , etc. Debts like autoloans and personal debts are in my opinion are higher risk because of the value of the asset<br>
                   almost always going down, and should be avoided of possible.You can also use this in sequence with the compound <br>
                   interest calculator, to determine if a debt is finciacially smart, and the opportunity cost of that debt. As we<br>
                   talked about before changing the term of a 30 year mortgage to a 15 year mortgage saved us close to $ 40,000<br>
                   dollars, and when we factored in the interest that could have been earned it saved us over $ 160,000 so it is<br>
                   really important to understand these concepts, and use these calculators to make the best decision, to improve,<br>
                   our fincancial future.<br><br><br>
